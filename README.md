<br>
🌵 Challenges - Biggest issue this week between family health issues was time constraints and quickly learning a new unknown library. As well as completing most of the structure of our application
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - Learning a new library such as Framer-Motion and implementing it into my page. 
<br>
🔮 Next Steps -Next steps is to finish the basic structures setup and linking the api with the application.

<br>

Please discuss the following:  
#### Page #1   
- Home  
- Landing page for website giving user an idea of what the site is about.

#### Page #2   
- Search  
- Page used for user to search a character api databse from the Rick and Morty tv show and return the data found.   

#### Page #3   
- About  
- Give users a full explanation of what and how this application works   

#### Page #4   
- Submit  
- Gives users a chance to submit any missing character data from the show Rick and Morty    

#### Remember that creating a project board, issues, and milestones is 50% of your grade!     
If you are having trouble, contact your instructor ASAP, you might need to be part of the ePortoflio group to have better access.




<br>

### Milestone 3
⚙️ Overview -By this Milestone, you should have a fully functioning app. In the last week, you should only have to do styling and minor tweaks.
Your project/app must contain the following:
A working/compilable React project that contains no errors or warnings.
It must contain at least 4 pages/views.
An example of these are:
Dashboard/Main
User/Settings
Search
Detail Page
Your pages must contain real data and not placeholder text.
React Routing to all pages must be working as well as any other links or buttons that you need.
Connect to at least 1 free API that must return JSON data.
It must have some persistent data using MongoDB OR Local Storage.
Node/Express Backend.
This is mostly if you are using MonogDB.
You will most likely have to create a server to run first as well.
If you choose to use Local Storage, then just make sure your NPM is free of any errors or warnings.
The project must use at least 2 different libraries, not including React itself
One of these libraries must be the library your tutorial was based on in 1.4 Exercise 01.
<br>
🌵 Challenges - Once again my biggest challenge with Personal family health issues currently and work is timing, but with that being said I believe my second biggest challenge is deciding on another library to implement into my project this week. Also making things more Responsive is becoming challenging as well
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - Finsihing my first full functional and completed Web Application while learning new libraries and resources as well. 
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - Next will be fine tuning everything styling, funtionality etc making sure it is as seemless as possible for a final submission.

<br>

Please discuss the following:
#### API    
- https://rickandmortyapi.com
- A huge fan of the show and love their styles  
- in our SearchPage.js to implemnt our return results of character data.    

#### 1st Library
- https://www.framer.com/motion/
- https://youtu.be/osoQbvLLu9A
- Love the features of being able to animate an object    
- used Framer-Motion for our banner logo Rick and Morty!    

#### 2nd Library    
- https://howlerjs.com
- Allows to play a great background theme song for the shows site.  
- implemented into our entire web application in our App.js as an AudioPlayer component

#### Persistent Data    
- LocalStorage as it was better for the submission form to keep persistent data that has to be approved before added into the character api.  
- Used in our Submit Page for users to submit a character we do not have in our API data with a form submission area including a upload photo section also.    
- Again used in our Submit page setup for users to submit any new characters they did not find using the search page.

<br>

### Milestone 4
⚙️ Overview - Requirements For Milestone #4
Full-styled project using Tailwind, Bootstrap, or any other framework/library of your choosing.
Your project/app should look visually appealing and must be easy for the end user to use, navigate, and understand.
Each page should contain real data and no placeholder or empty pages.
Fix or update any last-minute issues found since Milestone #3.
Docs
Update your Readme file with your progress so far. It should contain at least the following information:
The name of the framework/library that you have chosen for this project.
A brief explanation of why you chose that specific one.
A brief explanation of any functionality code that you updated since Milestone #3.
Any other enhancements or features that you would like to make in the features.
Reminder, if this is not done, your project will not be graded.
<br>
🌵 Challenges - My toughest Challenge this week along with Time Management was styling my Api search bar with our setup, as well as getting all the fine little tweaks just right in order to have a more smooth and professional setup look. 
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - I succesfully refractored my entire project and used as little .css as possible instead using our tailwindcss properites to style 90% of our project.
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - The only thing left to do now is to setup a back-end per instructors advisse for our application for better persistant data which I will continue to do even after this course. 

<br>

Please discuss the following:  
#### Changes
- A few styling changes have been made due to using Tailwindcss but not much noticable, and other than that mainly fine tuning our styles and having a more professional adjusted look. 

#### Styling
- Tailwindcss is a great framework to refractor your project and helped downsize our entire application by over hald doing so. This was impressive and fun to not only implement but see physical changes and downsize for more compressed projects. I have chosen this framework specifically to help with time-management in order to get the project done correctly and on time.

# Project Overview

### Your project will use the MERN Tech Stack and must include the following:

-   A Git Repo, with a master, dev, and milestone branches
-   Readme File that explains your project and tracks your milestones
-   A React Front End
-   React Routing with  _at least_  4 different views/pages
    -   Dashboard/Main
    -   User/Settings
    -   Search
    -   Detail Page
-   Node/Express Backend
-   A Mongo DB Element OR Local Storage for persistent data
-   Connect to at least 1 free API
-   The project must use at least 2 different libraries, not including React itself
    -   One of these libraries you will create a tutorial for in Exercise 01
-   It should look visually appealing and must be easy for the end-user to use and understand. You may use Tailwind or any other front-end library/framework.

**Milestone #1 (Due: Monday of Week 2)**

-   Decide on your topic and theme for your project.
    -   Check out the Free API sites for some ideas of an API that you can utilize
        -   [Apipheny](https://apipheny.io/free-api/)  
            
        -   [Mixed Analytics](https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/)  
            
        -   [I Am Sajan](https://iamsajan.com/free-api-without-an-api-key/)  
            
-   Functional Spec that explains the scope of the work and the deadlines that must be met.  
    
-   Create a Wireframe Prototype in Figma that will help non-tech people understand your idea.
    -   Keep in mind that a lot of your bosses will need only high-level concepts and will not be concerned with the actual code. The code is your job.

**Milestone #2 **(Due: Monday of Week 3)****

-   Create your Git Repo using the provided link, which will clone over a blank repo.
-   Start to code your project.
    -   I will not give you a step-by-step guide for this.
    -   At this point, you must use your skills and build it out yourself.
-   Along the way, if you get stuck, you may reach out to the lab assistants, but remember this is YOUR portfolio project, and troubleshooting your own code is a part of this process.
-   By Milestone #2, I am going to be checking that you have a React app that can compile without error and that you have your navigation up and running.

**Milestone #3 **(Due: Monday of Week 4)****

-   By this point, you should have a functional prototype of your project. It might not look pretty yet, but that is what the final week is for.
-   Your Git Repo should have a number of significant commits pushed to it.

**Milestone #4 **(Due: Sunday of Week 4)****

-   Your completed project will be due.
-   You must create a (3 to 10) minute long video that goes through your project, what you did this month, and the technologies that you used to get it working.
    -   Remember it is your job to sell your work and really show it off.
